    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pan Seared Salmon is one of my favorite low calorie meals. Typically you can get a bag of salmon pretty cheap from Aldi, and it is a decent option for meal prep for the week.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the salmon with the salt and a few grinds of pepper</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering</li>
        <li>Cook the salmon, without moving, skin side up, until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the fillets and reduce the heat to medium</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until done to your liking, 4 to 5 minutes more</li>
        <li>Transfer to a platter and serve</li>
    </ol>
